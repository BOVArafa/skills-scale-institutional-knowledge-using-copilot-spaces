## Proposing and Maintaining New Roles

As projects grow and evolve, new roles may be needed to address emerging responsibilities or specializations. Follow this process to propose and add new personas:

### When to Add a New Role
- A distinct set of responsibilities emerges that doesn't clearly fit existing roles
- Cross-functional collaboration would benefit from explicit role definition
- New team members need clear guidance on a specialized function
- Industry best practices suggest a role that's not currently documented

### Proposal Process
1. **Document the Need**: Create an issue explaining why the new role is needed, what gaps it addresses, and how it differs from existing roles
2. **Define the Role**: Draft the role following the standard structure (Role Summary, Responsibilities, Goals, Typical Communication, Interactions with Other Roles)
3. **Review with Stakeholders**: Ensure the role definition aligns with team structure and doesn't create confusion or overlap
4. **Update Documentation**: Add the new persona to this document following the established format
5. **Communicate**: Share the update with relevant teams and update any training materials

### Maintenance Guidelines
- Review personas annually or when significant organizational changes occur
- Update interaction patterns when new roles are added
- Ensure responsibilities remain current with evolving practices
- Remove or consolidate roles that are no longer relevant
