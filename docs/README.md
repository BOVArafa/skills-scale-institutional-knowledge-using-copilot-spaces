# OctoAcme Project Management Overview

OctoAcme runs projects with an iterative, outcome-focused lifecycle that moves from initiation through planning, execution, release, and retrospective. Initiation begins with a concise Project One-pager that captures the problem, success metrics, stakeholders, and a go/no‑go decision. Approved initiatives are broken into shippable backlog items using a standardized template that includes title, acceptance criteria, estimate, and owner; planning produces a release plan and a documented Definition of Done. Execution is managed on a project board (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done) with guidance for small pull requests, CI gating, and merge approval policies.

Roles and responsibilities are explicit: Product Managers define outcomes and prioritize the backlog, Project Managers coordinate plans, schedules, risks, and communications, Developers implement and test code, and QA validates acceptance criteria. Regular team rhythms — daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, demos at sprint or milestone ends, and monthly stakeholder updates — ensure transparency and alignment. The docs include templates for weekly status updates and incident communications so teams can keep stakeholders informed and escalate issues when needed.

Quality assurance and risk-management practices are integrated into the development flow: automated unit, integration, and security scans run in CI, smoke and end-to-end tests validate critical flows before release, and manual QA is applied where necessary. Releases follow a checklist (pre-release checks, staging smoke tests, rollback plans) and use incident playbooks for rapid response. Continuous improvement is enforced through retrospectives that produce prioritized action items tracked back into the backlog, and the repository includes an ISSUE_TEMPLATE for proposing updates to process docs so the playbook evolves.
